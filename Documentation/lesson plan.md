**Activities:**
* **Enhancing the UI:**  
  + Godwin & Aviona will refine CSS styles to align with the persona’s color scheme and visual aesthetic.
  + Implement advanced CSS (transitions, animations, flexbox/grid improvements).
* **Interactive Elements:**  
  + Arvin & Domeld will introduce JavaScript for:
    + Navigation menus
    + Modals/pop-ups
    + Form validation and interactive elements
* **Role-Specific Tasks:**  
  + Aviona & Godwin – Finalize high-fidelity designs in Figma.
  + Developers – Implement interactive components into the project.
  + Sean – Update documentation and draft initial test cases.
* **Peer Review & Feedback:**  
  + We’ll review each other’s work to ensure design consistency, usability, and smooth functionality.

**2-Hour Demo:**
* Live demonstration on refining CSS styles and implementing interactive JavaScript components.
* Walkthrough of debugging common issues in web development.
* Showcase best practices for maintaining design consistency and responsiveness.

**Takeaway:**  
Students should deliver a core version of their web application with refined design elements and interactive features that align with the persona’s requirements.

## **Week 4: API Introduction, Integration & Testing**

**Activities:**
* **API Fundamentals:**  
  + Introduction to RESTful APIs and JSON data.
  + Discuss how APIs can enrich the user experience by integrating external data.
* **Practical API Integration:**  
  + Developers integrate an external API (e.g., weather, news, or any relevant data source based on the persona) into the web application.
  + Hands-on session to fetch data using JavaScript (fetch API or Axios).
* **Testing & Quality Assurance:**  
  + The Documentation & Testing team leads the group in writing test cases for new features.
  + Use of tools like Postman for API testing.
* **Design Adjustments:**  
  + Figma Designers collaborate with Developers to adjust UI elements based on dynamic data.
  
**2-Hour Demo:**
* Live demo of connecting a web application to a public API.
* Step-by-step integration process: fetching data, parsing JSON, and updating the UI dynamically.
* Walkthrough of testing strategies and using debugging tools to resolve integration issues.

**Takeaway:**  
By the end of Week 4, each team should have successfully integrated at least one API into their web app, with dynamic content reflecting real-time data, alongside a documented testing strategy.
